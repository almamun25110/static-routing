        An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, which
        are typically of the same data type, in a linear sequence. These
        elements are identified by an index, a number that indicates their
        position, and can be accessed to retrieve or modify them. The term
        "array" can also refer to any systematic arrangement of objects in rows
        and columns.
