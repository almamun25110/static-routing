        <p>I have travelled many times with my family. I have travelled by flight, by train, etc. But the most exciting one was when I was travelling to Mumbai with my family. The plan to visit Mumbai was made just to have a great time by train. There was no specific reason to travel or visit Mumbai but the train journey is so fascinating for us that we decided to travel by train. We just spent three days in Mumbai and had a great time shopping but we spent 5 days travelling by train. A train journey can never be compared with any other journey or any other excitement. Travelling by flight would just take a few hours and it is the fastest means to travel and saves a lot of time. But at times, we just miss our train journeys, we miss the continuous calls of the stall vendors shouting biryani, chai… garam chai…, bread omelette, etc. When we miss the train journeys, this chorus would just bounce in our ears. The train would pass through the villages, forests, seas, rivers, etc. This makes the train journey so exciting because we meet nature closely.

        While travelling from one place to the other by train, we get in contact with different people. We make new friends, the children enjoy the most, and there are a lot of memories. It is so hard to control our cravings while travelling by train. We would rush to a food stall and buy any food, and parents would not even stop us.
